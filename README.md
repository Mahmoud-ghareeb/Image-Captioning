# Caption ME

A project that generate captions about images 

## Model
I have splited the model into two parts
1. Encoder part <br>
   in the encoder part i used a pretrained MobileNetV3Large model to decode the features in the image
3. decoder part <br>
   i made the decoder part consist of Three parts
   1. LSTM
   2. Multi head attention
   3. Dense for output

 ## results
I was be able to get a pretty high accuracy score compareing to other notebooks with accuracy 81%

## inference
I got a pretty good decsription about the images
